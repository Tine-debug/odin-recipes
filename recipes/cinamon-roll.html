	<h2> Ingredients </h2>
	<h3>Dough</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 cup soy milk</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
		<li>½ cup warm water (100 to 110 degrees F/40 to 45 degrees C)</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
		<li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
		<li>5 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>1 cup mashed sweet potatoes</li>
		<li>½ cup white sugar</li>
		<li>¼ cup soy yogurt</li>
		<li>¼ cup vegan butter (such as Earth Balance®), melted</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons grated orange zest</li>
		<li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon baking soda </li>
		<li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Filling</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>2 cups firmly packed light brown sugar</li>
		<li>1 cup chopped toasted pecans</li>
		<li>¾ cup vegan butter (such as Earth Balance®), melted</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Glaze</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>¼ cup vegan cream cheese substitute (such as Tofutti™)</li>
		<li>1 ½ cups powdered sugar</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons soy milk</li>
		
	<h2> Instructions </h2>

	<ol>
		<li>Combine soy milk with apple cider vinegar; let sit for 5 minutes.</li>
		<li>Combine water, sugar, and yeast for dough in a food processor fitted with the metal blade; pulse 4 times or until just combined. Remove the blade, scraping yeast mixture into the bowl. Let stand for 5 minutes.</li>
		<li>Insert the short plastic dough blade. Add 1/2 cup of the flour and process for 2 minutes. Add 4 more cups flour, mashed potatoes, soy milk-vinegar mixture, sugar, soy yogurt, melted vegan butter, orange zest, salt, and baking soda; process for 2 minutes. Add remaining 1 cup flour and process until a dough forms and comes together to hold its shape, about 2 more minutes.</li>
		<li>Transfer dough to a well-greased bowl; turn to coat all sides. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, mix brown sugar, pecans, vegan butter, and cinnamon for filling together in a bowl. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
		<li>Punch dough down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 10x18-inch rectangle. Spread evenly with filling, leaving a 1-inch border around the top and bottom. Starting at one of the long sides, roll dough jelly-roll fashion. Cut into 12 equal slices and arrange in the prepared baking pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 30 minutes.</li>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
		<li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, 17 to 20 minutes. Remove rolls from the oven and invert onto a baking sheet. Invert again onto a serving platter and let cool, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
		<li>While the rolls are cooling, beat cream cheese substitute until smooth. Mix in powdered sugar and soy milk until smooth.</li>
		<li>Spread glaze on rolls. Serve warm.</li>
